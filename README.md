# uva-linklab-influx
For now, this project handles the linklab.influx operation in Python with the following implementations
- Part1: A python interface to access Living Link Lab data
- Part2: A Python interface to check device_status in the Link Lab according to certain device (or called sensor) type

Please refer [influx_python_interface.ipynb](https://github.com/AustinFengYi/uva-linklab-influx/blob/main/influx_python_interface.ipynb) to have more information about how we implement the program in Python to 
1. Query link lab influx data
2. Check certain devices' [online/offline] status
